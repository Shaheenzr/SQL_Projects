# SQL_Projects
This repository is dedicated for all the SQL projects I have worked and practiced as a team or individual

Project 1: Capturing Immunization record (Kaiser Permanente).
In this project, we created a new database with 7 different tables for capturing immunization records for new students joining university and generating their blood reports accordingly.
We used Joins, Triggers and Procedures to answer different questions and handle different scenarios.
Used Tableau to visualize the data and show different insights within the data.

Project 2: Answering Business questions using Funnel Marketing model.Through SQL, I determined total number of users in each step of the funnel, as well as the percentage of users who completed each step.This analysis helped designer eyewear company (Warby Parker) to gain insights into user's behavior and come up with strategic campaigns and business decisions.I determined the conversion rate of customer journey from "quiz → home_try_on → purchase".I also found out the difference in purchase rates between customers who were given 3 pairs of glasses and the ones who were given 5 for home trials.
