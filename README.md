# SQL_Projects
This repository is dedicated for all the SQL projects I have worked and practiced as a team or individual

Project 1: Capturing Immunization record (Kaiser Permanente)
In this project, we created a database with 7 different tables for capturing immunization records for new students joining univerity and generating their reports accordingly.
We used Joins, Triggers and Procedures to answer different questions and handle different scenarios.
Used Tableau to visualize the data and show different insights within the data.
